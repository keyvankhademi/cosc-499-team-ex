# COSC 499 Team 8 Github excercise

We have decided that this repository will be a demonstration of several sorting algorithms for sorting numbers.

We will demonstrate several different sorting algorithms, with each member opening their own PR and demonstrating their own sorting algorithm.

Each Algorithm will also have it's own unit tests to ensure correctness.
